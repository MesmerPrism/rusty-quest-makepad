# Rusty Quest Makepad Camera Shell

This is the clean Makepad-first Quest camera app lane for Rusty Morphospace.
APK build, profile staging, `.MakepadAppXr` launch, and readiness scoring are
owned by `rusty-quest-makepad` plus `rusty-quest`; Rusty-XR-era scripts and
paths are historical compatibility evidence only. Active Makepad
app/settings/profile work lives in `rusty-makepad`, `rusty-quest`,
`rusty-quest-makepad`, and the `makepad-morphospace` fork checkout.

The first pass was intentionally a synthetic OpenXR smoke app. It proved the
Makepad Quest APK path, emitted Rusty Quest Makepad log markers, exercised Makepad's XR
root, and documented the integration gaps before adding camera transport,
stream, or broker behavior. The current source now keeps that synthetic stereo
comparison scene and adds a bounded Android NDK Camera2 metadata/acquisition
probe plus a delayed Makepad-owned paired hardware-buffer import probe so
renderer smoke runs can be lined up against the custom APK camera-stereo
baseline before performance parity is measured.

This example consumes one full revision of the maintained Makepad fork as an
app-shell dependency only. Morphospace core stays Makepad-independent; the
historical relationship and fork-patch policy are documented in the public
[Rusty-XR Makepad fork relationship](https://github.com/MesmerPrism/Rusty-XR/blob/b6d726ee40ba67a3756ecf13f4aa3f315ea33e7a/docs/MAKEPAD_FORK_RELATIONSHIP.md).

## Current Scope

- Uses `cargo-makepad android --variant=quest`.
- Uses maintained Makepad fork revision
  `c74a9659bd5cd92d9bd9b6f3627c24a893444354`, pinned by full `rev` in
  `Cargo.toml` and mirrored in `Cargo.lock`. The `dev` branch is an update
  source, not a dependency-resolution input. Local evidence builds run the
  wrapper with `-MakepadSourceRoot <makepad-fork-checkout>` or
  `RUSTY_QUEST_MAKEPAD_SOURCE_ROOT` so the packager and app Makepad dependencies
  both come from the maintained fork checkout. The wrapper requires that source
  root by default. Use `-NoPatchMakepadXrFromSource` only for an intentional
  upstream or pinned dependency comparison.
- Uses `makepad-xr` with a minimal `XrRoot` plus a small synthetic stereo
  comparison scene. Earlier isolation passes tried a status panel, a simple
  cube marker, `XrPermissionsFlow`, and an empty root.
- Reads its startup marker values through `rusty-quest-projection-runtime-config`, so this
  shell is already attached to a framework-neutral Morphospace core crate.
- Resolves `rusty-quest-projection-runtime-config` through the declared
  manifest-relative `rusty-quest` sibling. That path is a composition-only
  build edge: a standalone checkout of this repository is not a complete Cargo
  closure, and `rusty-quest` retains ownership of the dependency's build truth.
- Emits `RUSTY_QUEST_MAKEPAD_CAMERA_STATUS` and
  `RUSTY_QUEST_MAKEPAD_STEREO_COMPARISON` on startup.
- On Android, emits those startup markers directly through logcat under a
  Rusty Quest Makepad tag so device smoke tests have a reliable startup signal.
- On Android, starts one bounded NDK Camera2 diagnostic pass that emits
  `RUSTY_QUEST_MAKEPAD_CAMERA2_METADATA` after enumeration and
  `RUSTY_QUEST_MAKEPAD_CAMERA2_ACQUISITION` during setup, first-frame, and
  completion. The pass opens one selected `PRIVATE` `AImageReader` source and
  records the first hardware-buffer descriptor.
- On Android, after that bounded acquisition window, selects a left/right source
  pair, starts two Makepad-owned camera playbacks with distinct
  `VideoExternal` textures, and emits
  `RUSTY_QUEST_MAKEPAD_HARDWARE_BUFFER_IMPORT` plus
  `RUSTY_QUEST_MAKEPAD_STEREO_PROJECTION` as Makepad's Android/Vulkan video
  texture path enumerates, starts, prepares, and accepts both camera hardware
  buffers.
- Emits `RUSTY_QUEST_MAKEPAD_CADENCE` samples every five seconds, using Makepad
  `NextFrame` events for callback cadence and left/right
  `VideoTextureUpdated` events for Makepad camera texture progression. The
  marker also carries Makepad `XrUpdate` and draw-event rates so a low camera
  texture cadence can be separated from OpenXR loop cadence and app callback
  cadence.
- The maintained Makepad fork also emits public-safe Java activity and native
  bootstrap phase markers for Android activity creation, native handoff,
  EGL/GL setup, Vulkan readiness, and main-loop handoff.
- Keeps Android SDK, generated Java, generated manifest, native library, and APK
  output under ignored local build folders.
- The current source includes Makepad's `XrPermissionsFlow` so normal launcher
  startup can enter active XR presentation. Earlier isolation variants
  confirmed that the original GPU fault also appeared when the permission flow
  was removed.
- The current source imports a Makepad-owned paired camera source after XR
  startup and reports paired-buffer/projection readiness when both textures
  update. The default direct Camera2 lane uses the visually accepted CPU-YUV
  shader path. A diagnostic property can opt into app-owned `VideoExternal`
  texture ids so the Quest/Vulkan backend attempts direct hardware-buffer
  import, but that route is not the default until its stale-frame and color
  behavior is corrected in the Makepad import path.
- The current source can also use broker-managed synthetic H.264 stereo streams
  instead of opening Camera2 directly. On the Quest Vulkan path, that route asks
  the maintained Makepad fork to decode the streams with Android MediaCodec and
  hand decoded YUV planes into the same per-eye panel. This is the deterministic
  input lane for comparing transport, projection-stage, and multilayer
  processing costs without relying on a physical camera scene. A zero-copy
  surface-texture route remains a separate performance target.
- The current source can publish live XR controller pose samples from Makepad
  `XrUpdate` as the generic Manifold stream `stream.motion.object_pose`. This
  provider is opt-in through runtime properties and leaves projected-motion
  breath estimation outside the XR app; the app only samples controller
  `grip_pose` or `aim_pose` and publishes object-pose payloads to the local
  broker/Manifold command route.
- The current source has an opt-in mesh replay overlay for VR smoke checks. It
  consumes a public synthetic
  `rusty.matter.tools.glb_mesh_surface_sequence.v1` fixture, advances it on
  Makepad `XrUpdate`, and draws four representative moving mesh edges on the
  existing XR projection panel. This is the first headset-facing replay
  adapter for the same browser sequence shape; Matter still owns mesh/SDF,
  collision, and particle algorithms, and the Makepad shell only owns the VR
  overlay adapter.
- The Makepad projection shell mirrors the direct HWB composite profile's
  target-footprint joystick behavior: `offset-scale` maps right stick Y to the
  projection-area scale, with stick up growing the footprint and stick down
  shrinking it. The shader path remains Makepad-owned and uses the same
  peripheral stretch inner blend fields as the HWB reference profile.
- The clean headset route uses
  `fixtures/profiles/camera-hwb-live.bundle.json` and stages app-scoped
  `debug.rustyquest.makepad.*` properties through `rusty-quest` before launch.
  A generic `debug.rustyquest.*` readback is not evidence that this app consumed
  a setting.

## Build

Install or update the Makepad cargo extension from a Makepad checkout:

```powershell
cargo install --force --path <makepad-checkout>\tools\cargo_makepad
```

Install the Android toolchain into a local cache that is not committed:

```powershell
cargo makepad android --abi=aarch64 --sdk-path <local-makepad-android-sdk> install-toolchain
```

Build the Quest APK from this example directory with a host-matched Android
SDK:

```powershell
cargo makepad android --abi=aarch64 --variant=quest --no-icon --sdk-path=<local-makepad-android-sdk> --package-name=<public-example-package> --app-label="Rusty Quest Makepad Camera" build -p rusty-quest-makepad-camera-shell --release
```

For local evidence builds, prefer the wrapper because it preflights the selected
SDK before cargo runs and can run the maintained fork's `cargo-makepad` tool
while patching the app's Makepad dependency to that same checkout. The wrapper
requires this source root by default unless `-NoPatchMakepadXrFromSource` is
passed for a deliberate installed-tool or pinned-dependency comparison:

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\tools\Build-QuestMakepadCameraApk.ps1 `
  -UseWindowsHost `
  -SdkPath <host-matched-sdk> `
  -JavaHome <jdk-root> `
  -MakepadSourceRoot <makepad-fork-checkout>
```

The wrapper writes ignored build provenance to
`local-artifacts/quest-makepad-camera-apk/makepad-camera-apk-build-provenance.json`,
including Makepad source SHA, app-dependency patching mode, SDK profile, APK
path, copied APK path, and APK SHA-256.

Use `-UseWindowsHost` when the selected SDK is a Windows-host SDK. Without that
switch, the wrapper expects a WSL/Linux-host SDK and a Linux NDK prebuilt. A
path being reachable from WSL is not enough; the SDK must contain tools for the
host that runs `cargo-makepad`.

For consecutive evidence builds with `-MakepadSourceRoot`, the wrapper uses the
fork checkout's release `cargo-makepad` tool and a stable ignored patch
`CARGO_HOME` under `target/makepad-patch-cargo-home/<host>`. That keeps Cargo
source identity stable between no-change APK builds while still patching the
app's Makepad dependency to the same source checkout. Use
`-UseTemporaryPatchCargoHome` only when intentionally reproducing old
per-run-patch-home behavior.

The wrapper turns on Makepad Android phase timings by default through
`MAKEPAD_ANDROID_TIMINGS=1`. Warm no-change builds should show no `Adding ...`
lockfile churn and no dependency `Compiling ...` lines; inspect
`MAKEPAD_ANDROID_TIMING` markers when the remaining APK packaging steps still
take longer than expected.

For repeatable Morphospace evidence builds, record which host lane built the APK.
If a clean WSL/Linux-host rerun still fails while Makepad removes a missing
bundled font asset, treat that as a Makepad packager-route failure rather than
ordinary stale staging. After cleaning
`target/android/makepad-android-apk/` once, switch to the Windows-host wrapper
lane with `-UseWindowsHost` or state that Linux-host packaging itself is being
tested.

If the `cargo_makepad` tool still tries to run hardcoded
`build-tools/33.0.1/aapt` when the wrapper selected a Windows SDK with a
different build-tools version, the wrong or stale Makepad packager is being
used. Do not create a fake SDK shadow as the primary fix; update or select the
Makepad fork whose packager resolves installed SDK tools and host executable
names from `--sdk-path`.

For projection-footprint alignment work, use the same clean app package and
select the diagnostic properties through the settings/profile route rather than
reusing Rusty-XR-era one-off scripts:

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\tools\Build-QuestMakepadCameraApk.ps1 `
  -UseWindowsHost `
  -SdkPath <host-matched-sdk> `
  -MakepadSourceRoot <makepad-fork-checkout>
```

Enable the synthetic footprint target before the alignment launch when the goal
is to compare the Makepad `screen_to_camera` footprint against the Quest baseline
diagnostic profile without live camera pixels:

```powershell
adb shell setprop debug.rustyquest.makepad.projection.area.diagnostic 1
```

Set the diagnostic to `2` for footprint-only comparison. This keeps the
camera-domain projection target and colored border but suppresses the
screen-to-surface white guide, which can move when projection-area offsets are
being tuned and is not part of stage-1 footprint alignment.

When the diagnostic footprint itself needs tuning, use the same hotload helper
with the projection-area offsets, scales, X keystone, and midpoint bow. These
controls adjust the screen-space UVs before the Makepad `screen_to_camera` and
`screen_to_surface` homographies are evaluated, so they affect the footprint
target rather than the camera-content window. Treat them as diagnostic probes:
the reset/default state keeps keystone and bow neutral because the Quest baseline
reference path does not apply an equivalent pre-homography screen-domain warp.

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\examples\makepad-camera-shell\tools\Send-MakepadCameraControls.ps1 `
  -ProjectionAreaDiagnostic 2 `
  -ProjectionAreaLeftUv <left-eye-uv-offset> `
  -ProjectionAreaRightUv <right-eye-uv-offset> `
  -ProjectionAreaVerticalUv <vertical-uv-offset> `
  -ProjectionAreaScaleX <horizontal-scale> `
  -ProjectionAreaScaleY <vertical-scale> `
  -ProjectionAreaKeystoneX <x-keystone> `
  -ProjectionAreaBowX <midpoint-x-bow>
```

For live-camera review, the app-owned red border is a projection-footprint
witness only when logs also identify `liveCameraWindowDomain=projected_camera_uv`
and `s118ProjectedFootprintLiveWindow=true`. Earlier red-border slices could
draw the marker around a centered in-surface camera window, which made the
marked images appear farther apart than the Quest baseline projected footprint even
when the homography matrices were nearly identical.

For final screenshot comparison, disable the red border after reset so visual
analyzers compare camera content instead of the diagnostic outline:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\examples\makepad-camera-shell\tools\Send-MakepadCameraControls.ps1 `
  -ProjectionBorderOpacity 0
```

For a source-only VR mesh replay smoke, enable the panel overlay before launch:

```powershell
adb shell setprop debug.rustyquest.makepad.mesh.replay.enabled 1
adb shell setprop debug.rustyquest.makepad.mesh.replay.speed 1.0
adb shell setprop debug.rustyquest.makepad.mesh.replay.opacity 0.84
```

On desktop/host checks, use the matching environment keys:

```powershell
$env:RUSTY_QUEST_MAKEPAD_MESH_REPLAY_ENABLED = '1'
$env:RUSTY_QUEST_MAKEPAD_MESH_REPLAY_SPEED = '1.0'
$env:RUSTY_QUEST_MAKEPAD_MESH_REPLAY_OPACITY = '0.84'
```

The bundled fixture is
`apps/quest-makepad-camera-shell/fixtures/mesh-replay/synthetic-hand-mesh-sequence.json`.
External hand-mesh recordings stay out of this public repo until a scoped
artifact-ingest and provenance route exists.

Run on a selected Quest device:

```powershell
cargo makepad android --devices=<quest-serial> --abi=aarch64 --variant=quest --no-icon --sdk-path=<local-makepad-android-sdk> --package-name=<public-example-package> --app-label="Rusty Quest Makepad Camera" run -p rusty-quest-makepad-camera-shell --release
```

This example is not a root-workspace member. Use
`cargo check --manifest-path apps\quest-makepad-camera-shell\Cargo.toml` from
the repository root, or plain `cargo check` from this directory; do not use
`cargo check -p rusty-quest-makepad-camera-shell` from the root workspace.
For source changes, run
`cargo test --locked --manifest-path apps\quest-makepad-camera-shell\Cargo.toml`
as the host-side Rust validation gate for parser, metadata, projection math,
and committed lockfile resolution. Do not use a plain
`cargo check --target aarch64-linux-android` as the Android acceptance gate for
this Makepad lane; it only compiles the Rust target and does not exercise the
actual packager. Android acceptance is a successful wrapper build through
`tools/Build-QuestMakepadCameraApk.ps1` with `-MakepadSourceRoot
<makepad-fork-checkout>` or `RUSTY_QUEST_MAKEPAD_SOURCE_ROOT` when Makepad-side
packaging or bridge code matters. That source root is required by default and
patches app Makepad dependencies by default; use `-NoPatchMakepadXrFromSource`
only for a deliberate pinned-dependency comparison.

When Android-only Rust in this example changes, optional target probes can add
partial target coverage:

```powershell
cargo check --manifest-path apps\quest-makepad-camera-shell\Cargo.toml --target aarch64-linux-android
cargo test --manifest-path apps\quest-makepad-camera-shell\Cargo.toml --target aarch64-linux-android --no-run
```

These are not required gates and not package validation. The source includes an
Android-only binary `main` shim so the direct target check can compile
Android-only modules while Makepad's generated app still launches through the
JNI entrypoint emitted by `app_main!`. If the no-run test probe compiles the
edited Rust modules and stops only at final test linking because no `cc`/NDK
target linker is configured, record it as Android-target Rust compilation
reaching the edited path with a known final linker failure. Do not report it as
passed tests, and do not add extra linker/toolchain setup only to make this
optional probe link unless it is later promoted to CI or a required local gate.

Keep the Makepad options before `build` or `run` and use `--key=value` for
paths and package/app values. Before treating an APK as fresh evidence, remove
or timestamp `target/android/makepad-android-apk/`, record the rebuilt APK
hash, and extract `lib/arm64-v8a/libmakepad.so` for diagnostic string checks.
Delete generated `target/` output before public pushes and public boundary
scans.

For unattended camera validation after install, pregrant the declared runtime
camera permissions before the measurement window:

```powershell
adb -s <quest-serial> shell pm grant <public-example-package> android.permission.CAMERA
adb -s <quest-serial> shell pm grant <public-example-package> horizonos.permission.HEADSET_CAMERA
```

For projected-motion breath calibration, enable the controller pose provider
before launching the Makepad XR activity. The default target is the local broker
on `127.0.0.1:8765`, publishing `stream.motion.object_pose` at 20 Hz from the
right controller grip pose:

```powershell
adb -s <quest-serial> shell setprop debug.rusty.manifold.pose.publish.enabled true
adb -s <quest-serial> shell setprop debug.rusty.manifold.pose.stream stream.motion.object_pose
adb -s <quest-serial> shell setprop debug.rusty.manifold.pose.controller right
adb -s <quest-serial> shell setprop debug.rusty.manifold.pose.kind grip
adb -s <quest-serial> shell setprop debug.rusty.manifold.pose.sample.hz 90
```

The projection-target joystick scale control is on by default for the current
calibration profile and can be made explicit with:

```powershell
adb -s <quest-serial> shell setprop debug.rustyquest.makepad.projection.target.joystick.controls offset-scale
```

Use `off` for comparison captures where controller input must not affect the
projection area scale.

The current working live-camera projection setup is the direct hardware-buffer
Makepad XR profile with a passthrough underlay border and the peripheral stretch
target-inner-band blend. The guarded launcher now defaults to that profile:
`-ProjectionBorderPolicy passthrough-underlay`,
`-ProcessingLayer peripheral-stretch`, `-ProjectionSampleMode camera`,
`-PeripheralStretchBlendMode target-inner-band`,
`-PeripheralStretchCornerMode target-footprint`,
`-ProjectionTargetJoystickControls offset-scale`, and direct camera hardware
buffer external enabled. Runtime properties for this app must use the
`debug.rustyquest.makepad.*` namespace, while Manifold broker/PMB controls use
`debug.rusty.manifold.*`. A successful generic `debug.rustyquest.*` readback is
not proof that this Makepad XR app consumed the setting.

For PMB scale bridge setup after manually tuning the headset target scale with
the right joystick, run:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\examples\makepad-camera-shell\tools\Start-MakepadPmbScaleBridge.ps1 `
  -Serial <quest-serial> `
  -Mode controller
```

Use `-Mode polar` for the Polar acceleration path. The script maps volume 0 to
the loaded base scale (`debug.rustyquest.makepad.projection.target.scale`, or
`1.0` when unset) and maps volume 1 to the most recent
`projectionTargetScale` logged by the headset. Pressing the right primary
button resets the in-app scale back to the loaded base. Add
`-SendCalibrationCommand` when a local Manifold broker is ready to accept
`command.breath.begin_calibration`.

MediaProjection is different: it still requires the headset consent flow for
each capture session. A launcher can prepare install, launch, and ordinary
runtime grants, but it should report a blocked MediaProjection consent state
instead of claiming it can bypass the headset prompt.

The generated APK lands under
`target/android/makepad-android-apk/rusty_quest_makepad_camera_shell/apk/`.

The Makepad runner starts the generated launcher activity. Use the launcher or
normal generated activity for active XR presentation; with `XrPermissionsFlow`
enabled, that path switches into the generated XR activity. Directly launching
the generated XR activity remains useful as a bootstrap/control smoke only,
because the permission flow can switch back to the paired normal activity:

```powershell
adb -s <quest-serial> shell am start -n <public-example-package>/<generated-xr-activity>
```

For end-user startup gates, prefer the guarded launcher harness over one-off
`monkey` or single `am start` commands:

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\tools\Invoke-QuestMakepadCameraReadiness.ps1 `
  -Serial <quest-serial> `
  -Apk <fresh-makepad-apk> `
  -OutDir <ignored-artifact-dir>
```

The harness builds the `camera-hwb-live` runtime bundle, applies the
`debug.rustyquest.makepad.*` property plan through `rusty-quest`, installs the
APK, starts `io.github.mesmerprism.rustyquest.makepad.camera/.MakepadAppXr`
with `com.oculus.intent.category.VR`, and writes a readiness scorecard from
final property readbacks, focused activity state, direct HWB/Vulkan import
markers, OpenXR frame submission, camera texture cadence, and targeted
fatal/GPU-fault checks. Projection-mapping and visual-release markers are
reported separately so route ownership evidence is not confused with final
projection parity.

For presentation controls where the normal launcher hop is not the test subject,
start the generated XR activity first:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\examples\makepad-camera-shell\tools\Invoke-MakepadCameraDeviceGate.ps1 `
  -Serial <quest-serial> `
  -Apk <fresh-makepad-apk> `
  -PackageName <public-example-package> `
  -LauncherActivity <generated-launcher-activity> `
  -XrActivity <generated-xr-activity> `
  -OutDir <ignored-artifact-dir> `
  -PreferDirectVrActivity
```

For broker H.264 parity, start the broker first, then let the guarded device
gate set the Makepad runtime properties before launch. Use broker-synthetic for
deterministic source/projection checks:

```powershell
adb -s <quest-serial> shell am start -n <broker-package>/<broker-activity>

powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\examples\makepad-camera-shell\tools\Invoke-MakepadCameraDeviceGate.ps1 `
  -Serial <quest-serial> `
  -Apk <fresh-makepad-apk> `
  -PackageName <public-example-package> `
  -LauncherActivity <generated-launcher-activity> `
  -XrActivity <generated-xr-activity> `
  -OutDir <ignored-artifact-dir> `
  -PreferDirectVrActivity `
  -UseBrokerH264Synthetic
```

Use broker-camera for a physical Camera2 -> H.264 -> MediaCodec CPU-YUV run:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\examples\makepad-camera-shell\tools\Invoke-MakepadCameraDeviceGate.ps1 `
  -Serial <quest-serial> `
  -Apk <fresh-makepad-apk> `
  -PackageName <public-example-package> `
  -LauncherActivity <generated-launcher-activity> `
  -XrActivity <generated-xr-activity> `
  -OutDir <ignored-artifact-dir> `
  -PreferDirectVrActivity `
  -UseBrokerH264Camera `
  -BrokerH264LeftCameraId 50 `
  -BrokerH264RightCameraId 51 `
  -BrokerH264FrameRateHz 50
```

The 2026-06-03 direct/broker and YUV/HWB matrix, including the broker-side
single-stream stereo-combine decision, is summarized in
[`docs/broker-stereo-combine-plan-2026-06-03.md`](docs/broker-stereo-combine-plan-2026-06-03.md).

For raw projection-area alignment, the Makepad target uses the same full-layer
plus projected sub-area shape as the other public camera targets. The invalid
projection region can be launched as an opaque solid-red diagnostic border or
as a transparent border over native passthrough:

```powershell
# Direct Camera2, solid diagnostic border.
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\examples\makepad-camera-shell\tools\Invoke-MakepadCameraDeviceGate.ps1 `
  -Serial <quest-serial> `
  -Apk <fresh-makepad-apk> `
  -PackageName <public-example-package> `
  -LauncherActivity <generated-launcher-activity> `
  -XrActivity <generated-xr-activity> `
  -OutDir <ignored-artifact-dir> `
  -ProjectionBorderPolicy solid-red

# Direct Camera2, passthrough underlay border.
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\examples\makepad-camera-shell\tools\Invoke-MakepadCameraDeviceGate.ps1 `
  -Serial <quest-serial> `
  -Apk <fresh-makepad-apk> `
  -PackageName <public-example-package> `
  -LauncherActivity <generated-launcher-activity> `
  -XrActivity <generated-xr-activity> `
  -OutDir <ignored-artifact-dir> `
  -ProjectionBorderPolicy passthrough-underlay
```

The same `-ProjectionBorderPolicy` switch can be combined with
`-UseBrokerH264Camera` or `-UseBrokerH264Synthetic`. It sets
`debug.rustyquest.makepad.projection.border.policy` and pairs
`passthrough-underlay` with
`debug.rustyquest.makepad.native.passthrough.enabled=true`. The app writes alpha
zero outside the projected camera region for the underlay policy and keeps the
camera projection in the same full submitted render surface. Use the solid-red
policy when the actual projected camera footprint needs an unmistakable marker;
use passthrough-underlay for manual headset alignment against native
passthrough.
Add `-EnableNativePassthrough -ProjectionAreaOpacity <0..1>
-ProjectionBorderOpacity <0..1>` when you want a solid-red border with native
passthrough active behind the same full submitted surface. The area opacity
fades only valid projected camera pixels; the border opacity fades the
non-projection matte/border independently.
Add `-ProjectionDepthMeters <meters>` to set the head-anchored projection
surface depth explicitly. The guarded launcher writes
`debug.rustyquest.makepad.projection.depth.meters`, defaults to `1.0`, and logs the value
as `projectionDepthMeters` / `panelTargetDepthMeters` so Makepad depth remains
visible beside HWB and GL/OES. For canvas/custom parity runs, pass
`-CameraProjectionMode world-canvas -CameraProjectionGeometryProfile
full-frame-diagnostic` for the canvas-equivalent pass and
`-CameraProjectionMode display-screen-homography -CameraProjectionGeometryProfile
camera-projection` for the per-eye custom projection pass. The Makepad XR panel
is sized and placed from the same projection depth, preview FOV, vertical
offset, and raw overscan values before the camera shader runs. Keep the
build-time source mapping at `display-left-from-left-source` for current
projection evidence builds, matching the HWB and GLES/OES left/right camera-feed
convention; override `-DisplaySourceEyeMapping` only when the source-eye mapping
itself is the variable under test.
Add `-ProjectionAlphaMode red|green|blue|luma` or an inverse variant when the
valid camera window should reveal native passthrough based on source color.
The Makepad path uses premultiplied RGB, so alpha-zero mask regions do not leak
camera color. `tools\Send-MakepadCameraControls.ps1` accepts the same
alpha mode, scale, and bias properties for short headset A/B checks.
Set `makepad.processing.layer=blur` to enable the public diagnostic blur layer
for valid camera samples while keeping the same projection border policy. The
default blur settings keep the original 1280-domain route available:
`makepad.camera.blur.sample_domain=source-1280`,
`makepad.camera.blur.radius_px=2.0`,
`makepad.camera.blur.source_size_px=1280.0`, and
`makepad.camera.blur.sample_step_gain=4.0`, with
`makepad.camera.blur.tap_layout=final-pass-box-5x5`. Use
`fixtures\profiles\camera-hwb-live-blur-guide384.bundle.json` for the
Rusty-Vision guide-equivalent 384-domain route; it sets the active values to
`guide-384`, radius `1.0`, source size `384.0`, and step gain `1.0`, producing
the same `-2..+2` tap spacing over `1/384` UV steps without making that a
shader hard cap. That profile now selects
`makepad.camera.blur.render_graph=offscreen-guide-texture`: a low-resolution
guide graph performs horizontal blur from the external HWB camera input,
vertical blur into a guide texture, and leaves the final projection pass with a
single guide-texture sample instead of 25 external-camera samples per fragment.
The earlier final-pass probes remain useful comparison evidence: exact
guide-384 box blur dropped to roughly 47 FPS with about 18.6 ms GPU repaint,
while the 9-tap final-pass probe improved to roughly 62 FPS with about
13.1 ms GPU repaint but still reported stale frames. The offscreen guide graph
recovers the latest Quest VrApi samples to about `73/72` with `Stale=0` and
about 9-10 ms GPU repaint, although long readiness windows can still catch
intermittent stale samples. Visual color/projection acceptance is intentionally
separate: the current offscreen HWB guide path is performance evidence, not
accepted color conformance, and the observed green/pink cast belongs to the
next descriptor/color follow-up.

Do not treat the breathing-room/peripheral-stretch path as equivalent blur
evidence. That path is image processing over the camera projection, but its
heavy work is UV remapping, target-footprint masks, and border blending; the
final panel still takes one external camera sample per visible fragment. The
Morphospace blur path is a texture-kernel operation over the external HWB camera
texture, so `final-pass-cross-9tap` takes 9 external camera samples per
fragment and `final-pass-box-5x5` takes 25. The breathing-room reference stayed
at `FPS=72/72` or `73/72` with `Stale=0` and about 9.5 ms app/GPU timing
because it preserved the single-sample camera path.

The default broker-H.264 gate uses `127.0.0.1:8765`, left/right stream ports
`8879` / `8880`, `1280x1280`, 6 Mbps, and a live-bounded 45-second stream with
`max_packets=0`. Set `BrokerH264CaptureMs=0` when the gate needs to prove a
live/unbounded stream instead of a bounded capture window. The synthetic
profile also sets `diagnostic-grid`. The
broker-camera profile forwards requested left/right camera IDs and source FPS
to the public broker command. The Makepad path consumes broker stream-header
projection metadata, derives `surface_to_camera`, `screen_to_surface`, and
`screen_to_camera` rows from the current OpenXR view state, and reports decoded
CPU-YUV texture cadence. Treat this as deterministic source/projection-stage
or physical-camera transport parity for diagnostics; zero-copy texture
performance still needs its own run.

For this lane, `max_packets=0` is intentional: it requests the broker's
live/unbounded stream, and `BrokerH264CaptureMs=0` preserves that unbounded
duration through the generated Android broker player. Positive capture
durations remain useful when the test intentionally wants a bounded stream. If
a run reports one packet per eye, the decoder may not receive a complete
access-unit sequence and the source-parity gate is invalid. Do not replace
broker-synthetic H.264 parity with a locally generated texture unless the
question is explicitly renderer smoke rather than broker transport or
cross-stack input equivalence.

The summary records the requested freshness frame count, unique freshness
hashes, app/global GPU-fault, fatal, small hardware-buffer, stale-marker,
Meta performance stale analysis, broker-H.264 decode, and texture-cadence
counters. A ready run fails the gate when Meta performance stale analysis
reports `status=stale`; warmup stale that clears before the recent sample
window remains an `ok` run with the reason recorded. Record whether the run was
`launcher-attempt-1`, `launcher-attempt-2`, `direct-vr-fallback`, or
`direct-vr-attempt-1`; do not silently merge those launch classes.

## Known Affordances And Gaps

- Makepad owns the generated Android manifest, Java activities, OpenXR loader
  packaging, debug signing, install, and launch flow.
- The Quest variant generates both a normal launcher activity and an XR activity.
- The Makepad runner starts the launcher activity. End-user startup validation
  should use the launcher path; direct VR-category XR launch is a presentation
  control path when comparing against direct Quest baseline launches.
- Rusty Quest Makepad runtime profiles are not yet mapped from arbitrary Android intent
  extras into Makepad Rust. This smoke pass reads environment variables for
  desktop/tooling runs. The camera-alignment lane also has a narrow Android
  property hotload adapter for live headset tuning:
  `tools/Send-MakepadCameraControls.ps1` writes `debug.rustyquest.makepad` properties
  for horizontal alignment strength, additive left/right/vertical UV offsets,
  projection-footprint offsets/scales/X-keystone/midpoint bow, the synthetic
  projection-area diagnostic toggle, camera-window content scale,
  projection-border opacity, and projection-border policy; the running app
  polls those values. The
  projection-footprint keystone and bow controls are pre-homography diagnostics
  and reset to neutral.
- The first shared-core bridge is deliberately small: resolved profile values
  pass through `rusty-quest-projection-runtime-config` before logging. Camera metadata,
  stream framing, and scorecard models should be added the same way, through
  core crates first and Makepad adapters second.
- The current lane uses synthetic status/stereo-comparison markers, a bounded
  Camera2 metadata/acquisition probe, and a paired Makepad hardware-buffer
  import/projection-mapping probe.
- The maintained Makepad fork now exposes an explicit native OpenXR passthrough
  toggle plus end-frame diagnostics. After a clean install, grant both Scene
  Access and Headset Camera before classifying XR presentation; otherwise the
  permission flow can remain on the regular/preflight activity while app markers
  still emit. Loading/preflight is a failed launch state, not passthrough-off
  visual success. Earlier gates already proved the app-owned panel can visibly
  render live camera content; the remaining parity gap was world-space
  anchoring rather than per-eye camera/head-space mapping. The current gate
  re-enables native passthrough and restores that known-visible world-space
  panel positive control. S67a stayed active-XR and fault-clean but did not
  visibly recover the panel; artifact review traced the visible S62 target to
  the plain world-space vertex path, the higher panel pose, dark clear color,
  direct per-eye YUV sampling, and the thin pale border. S67a2 restored that
  exact visible-panel control on the maintained fork: launcher and direct-XR
  samples both showed the live app-owned panel, six byte-distinct screenshots,
  clean end-frame markers, and no app-process GPU-fault/fatal/small-buffer
  counters. S67b then disabled native passthrough while preserving that panel:
  launcher and direct-XR samples both showed the live app-owned panel against a
  solid black app background, with opaque OpenXR end-frame submission and
  byte-distinct screenshots. The requested non-black clear color did not appear
  visually, and the small 4x4 hardware-buffer warning class remains a tracked
  counter. The active S68 gate keeps that passthrough-off visible-panel state,
  keeps direct per-eye no-swap limited-BT.601 YUV sampling, and moves the panel
  from the S62 world-space transform to active-eye `draw_pass.camera_inv`
  placement. S68 is a placement/liveness gate, not final projection parity:
  static screenshots can prove the panel is visible and fresh, while headset
  motion is needed to classify whether it follows camera/head space instead of
  staying fixed in world space. The first S68 static gate passed in both
  launcher and direct generated-XR paths: the app-owned live camera panel and
  pale border stayed visible with native passthrough disabled, six-frame
  screenshot sequences were byte-distinct, and app/global GPU-fault and fatal
  counters stayed at zero. The small hardware-buffer warning class and
  environment-depth runtime logs remain tracked separately. Operator headset
  inspection then accepted S68 as clean per-eye panel projection. The remaining
  gaps are narrower: the camera feeds are swapped left/right between eyes, and
  panel alignment is not yet good enough for the intended stereo effect. The
  next gates fix source-eye mapping first, then tune alignment against the
  custom Quest baseline target notes before performance comparison. S69 changed only
  the display source-eye selector to `inverted_xr_view_id` /
  `display-left-from-right-source`; acquisition-order source indices remained
  logged separately. Operator review reported that this made the stereo eye
  alignment coherent, but the image is still horizontally mirrored. S69b keeps
  the source-eye mapping and adds a horizontal UV flip. The first S69b guarded
  gate reached active XR on `launcher-attempt-1`, captured six byte-distinct
  screenshots, kept stale S69/S68 path labels absent from the extracted native
  library, and preserved zero GPU-fault/fatal counters. Screenshot review shows
  the horizontal mirror patch active. Operator follow-up clarified that the
  flip is still required; S70 keeps it and changes only geometry: the panel is
  head-centered between display eyes and narrowed to the Quest baseline square camera
  target surface, about `0.92m x 0.92m` at `0.75m` depth, to address overlap
  alignment and horizontal stretch. Operator review accepted the S70 aspect
  correction but found a depth-dependent stereo mismatch: close objects are
  still misaligned while objects near `1m` are nearly coherent. S71 keeps the
  square aspect and mirror/source-eye mapping, but returns placement to the
  active-eye camera-inverse basis so the visible Makepad panel does not add a
  shared physical convergence plane. The guarded S71 launcher gate reached
  active XR on the first attempt, captured six byte-distinct screenshots,
  retained S71 marker strings while stale S70/S69/S68 path labels were absent,
  and preserved zero app/global GPU-fault and fatal counters. Operator headset
  inspection decides whether the remaining close-range mismatch is panel
  convergence or metadata/intrinsics projection. Operator inspection reported
  S71 is slightly worse than S70 for close-range stereo alignment, so S72
  reverts to the S70 visual basis and ports the Quest baseline projection delta into
  UV sampling rather than continuing to move the Makepad panel. This is not a
  scalar shift approximation: the app computes per-source
  `surface_to_camera_uv_homography` rows from Camera2 intrinsics, lens pose,
  stereo reference center, and the head-anchored preview surface, then the
  shader applies the selected 3x3 mapping before the accepted texture flip.
  S72 and S73 did not pass visually: the guarded launcher path reached active
  XR and emitted homography markers, but the panel became a monocolored
  camera-reactive surface while CPU YUV probes still showed live camera
  content. S74 hard-coded the logged homography rows in the shader and
  restored the camera feed, with the known parallax issue still visible. That
  makes dynamic Makepad shader-field delivery the active blocker before
  alignment work can continue. S75 kept the metadata rows dynamic but still
  failed visually after writing through the pre-draw dynamic instance/uniform
  path as well as the existing area patching path. S76 then moved the panel off
  nested `DrawCube` ownership and onto direct draw-vars ownership; the guarded
  launcher gate restored live camera pixels through dynamic metadata rows, with
  six byte-distinct screenshots and zero app/global GPU-fault or fatal
  counters. The remaining parity gap is projected-UV coverage: the Makepad
  shader currently clamps invalid projected UVs, while the public Quest baseline
  target falls back to oriented unprojected content UVs.
- Run-log review after S68 found one important distinction for the next fix:
  S51 already solved horizontal image mirroring with a vertical-only UV flip.
  The S68 issue is source-eye mapping, so S69 should swap the selected
  left/right camera texture sets or active-eye selection without changing the
  accepted no-swap limited-BT.601 color path.
- On Windows, the tested Makepad revision required local `cargo-makepad`
  packaging fixes for generated wrapper paths and dependent Rust shared-library
  bundling.
- Earlier Quest validation reached the generated XR activity and emitted the
  marker, but the device log also reported GPU page faults. That fault class was
  later narrowed below this Quest baseline smoke panel.
- A control run of Makepad's upstream XR example on the same headset also
  reported GPU page faults, so the investigation moved into Makepad's
  Android/Vulkan path rather than this example's scene content.
- The depth-stack comparison showed that Makepad's eager environment-depth path
  differs from the non-Makepad Rusty Morphospace composite stack, but follow-up splits
  still faulted without provider start, per-frame acquire/readback, or depth
  image view creation. Later splits also faulted without passthrough creation,
  without environment-depth provider/swapchain creation, and with zero
  composition layers submitted, without OpenXR color swapchain creation,
  without the OpenXR frame loop, without OpenXR session creation, and without
  Makepad OpenXR instance creation. A same-APK launch of the normal Makepad
  Android activity also reproduced the page-fault class. Later counter-app
  splits moved the active lead into Makepad's Android Vulkan window-swapchain
  recreation after acquire/present reports suboptimal: suppressing that
  recreation stayed clean, the same-toolchain baseline still faulted, and
  waiting the current window-frame fence before recreation stayed clean. That
  wait is now part of the maintained local Makepad fork state and a
  no-diagnostic counter repeat stayed clean. The current synthetic stereo APK
  built against that fork state now passes the launcher and generated-XR
  startup/liveness gate with no app-process GPU page-fault or fatal lines in
  the 90s windows. Repeated small hardware-buffer warnings remain tracked
  separately through Camera2 acquisition and Makepad hardware-buffer import.
  A later active-presentation gate reached Makepad OpenXR session creation and
  showed that passthrough could start while the runtime rejected environment
  depth provider setup; the maintained fork now treats environment depth as an
  optional feature so a depth-policy failure cannot block projection startup.
  See the repository-level GPU investigation note for the current attempt log.

## Validation Status

- `cargo check`: passes for this standalone package.
- Quest APK build: passes with the maintained Makepad fork checkout, including
  dependent Rust shared-library bundling.
- Current projection parity slice: the example is on S91. S86 restored real
  camera detail through direct fullscreen YUV sampling, proving the current
  Makepad fullscreen draw/YUV texture path. The maintained Makepad fork now
  exposes runtime per-eye OpenXR pose/FOV state to app Rust, and S87 validated
  that state with a fresh fault-clean device gate and live projected camera
  screenshots. S88 keeps that runtime homography path and ports the public fast
  shader's invalid-UV fallback policy so edge/invalid regions use a dimmed
  oriented content-surface sample instead of an immediate black return. The
  S88 device gate passed for launcher active-XR, runtime-view markers,
  homography-ready markers, byte-distinct screenshots, and fault counters; the
  remaining parity blocker is the close-range projection/parallax geometry
  mismatch against the public fast target, not camera acquisition. S89 keeps
  the S88 projection math but replaces the flattened cube panel with a single
  fullscreen quad so the shader input UV domain matches the target fullscreen
  pass more directly. S90 then removes a source-correlation ambiguity: the
  fork exposes Android camera IDs in Makepad video descriptors, and this
  example binds Makepad video streams to the Camera2 projection plan by camera
  ID before falling back to source index. The S90 launcher gate now shows
  `s90CameraIdSourceBinding=true`, `sourceBindingMode=camera-id`,
  runtime-view/homography readiness, byte-distinct screenshots, and fault-clean
  app/global counters. Operator review rejected S90 as projection parity because
  the visual result still had depth-dependent misalignment/parallax, an
  apparent source-eye flip, and a roll/orientation defect. S91 keeps the S90
  acquisition and Camera2/Makepad camera-ID binding, but separates display-eye
  homography row selection from inverted source-eye texture selection and
  changes the active texture UV orientation from 180-degree `flip-x-and-y` to
  vertical-only. The fresh S91 gate reached active XR, emitted S91 markers,
  captured six byte-distinct screenshots, and stayed fault-clean; treat S91 as
  best-effort until the next headset review.
- Quest launcher run: installs, starts, emits Java activity, native bootstrap,
  `RUSTY_QUEST_MAKEPAD_CAMERA_STATUS`, and
  `RUSTY_QUEST_MAKEPAD_STEREO_COMPARISON` startup markers, switches into active
  XR presentation through `XrPermissionsFlow`, and shows the synthetic stereo
  scene in headset. The S14 launcher pass retained app/`XrUpdate`/draw cadence
  near 90Hz, paired camera texture progression near 50Hz, and no app-process
  GPU page-fault or fatal lines.
- Quest generated-XR activity launch: emits the same startup marker set in a
  short capture, reaches Vulkan ready / before main loop, and keeps the app
  process alive in the longer liveness window with no app-process GPU page-fault
  or fatal lines.
- Camera2 metadata/acquisition gate: both Makepad launcher and generated-XR
  startup windows enumerate three Camera2 `PRIVATE` sources, select a
  back-facing 1280x1280 source with intrinsics and pose metadata, receive one
  hardware-buffer-backed frame, and complete the bounded probe with
  `status=ok`. The first-frame descriptor reports native format 35, usage
  131840, one layer, stride 1280, and a present buffer id.
- Makepad hardware-buffer import gate: both Makepad launcher and generated-XR
  short windows enumerate three Makepad camera sources and 66 camera formats,
  select a back-facing 1280x1280 YUV420 source, start the delayed
  `VideoExternal` import path, prepare playback at 1280x1280, and emit
  `makepadVulkanImport=true` on `VideoTextureUpdated`.
- Current direct-camera texture path: the visible panel defaults to the CPU-YUV
  route because it remains the Makepad color/reference path that matches HWB
  and OES visually. The hardware-buffer external route is opt-in via
  `debug.rustyquest.makepad.direct.camera.hardware.buffer.external=true`; cadence
  and projection markers include `cameraTexturePath`, `textureImportPath`,
  `cpuUploadPath`, and `visualColorStatus` so performance reviews cannot be
  mistaken for visual color acceptance. The guarded device gate exposes this as
  `-DirectCameraTexturePath cpu-yuv` or `hardware-buffer-external`, records
  `directCameraColorStatus`, and the parity suite can run both with
  `-MakepadDirectCameraTexturePath both`.
- Performance comparison gate: active-presentation comparison reopened after
  S14, but final parity performance is still blocked on visible Makepad camera
  projection. S14 proved launcher-path XR presentation and paired import/cadence
  with the synthetic scene visible. S15 confirmed the custom Quest baseline
  visibly renders proper stereo camera projection, but the current sample was
  performance-degraded. S16 proved marker-level Makepad camera-panel readiness,
  then visual inspection showed the headset still rendering the synthetic
  blue/red debug scene. S17-S20 removed that fallback scene, moved the panel
  under scene-owned `XrNode` routing, and proved a normal Makepad `DrawCube`
  diagnostic panel is visible from the same widget transform. S21 custom-shader
  variants still rendered black, and S22's native `Video` widget surface started
  but did not produce confirmed visible headset-camera playback. S23 added the
  Makepad `Video` headset-camera permission option and removed the unrelated
  custom-shader compile noise, but showed the video widgets must be reset before
  assigning headset-camera sources. S24 added that reset and exposed an Android
  video-cleanup completion gap. S25 tested a Makepad fork cleanup-completion
  patch, but that split was rejected and reverted after it reintroduced the
  Quest app-process GPU page-fault class when the native `Video` widget route
  proceeded. S26 restored the app-fault-clean manual `VideoExternal` route and
  showed the scene-owned cyan diagnostic panel in headset after scene access was
  granted. S27 disabled the solid diagnostic, S28 sampled `sample_video()`
  color directly, and S29 disabled the alignment-guide overlay by default. Use
  the launcher path for Makepad validation, not direct generated-XR launch, and
  verify the paired Makepad textures are the visible XR content before treating
  scorecards as final parity evidence.
- Current comparison target: the accepted source-provenance target run used
  visible stereo Camera2 projection at 72Hz, render scale `0.75`, no stale
  frames, and explicit Quest CPU/GPU level `4` / `4`. Future Makepad parity
  runs must capture the same device performance props, preserve the small
  hardware-buffer warning class separately from GPU-fault counters, and include
  screenshot or headset-cast visual review so a marker-only pass cannot be
  mistaken for projection parity.
- Current target-local HWB stretch performance envelope: the metadata-backed
  Makepad path is render-deadline bound at full XR render scale. Keep the
  device gate default at Quest CPU/GPU level `4` / `4` and
  `rustyquest.makepad.xrRenderScale=0.90` for the accepted visual/performance lane.
  Use CPU/GPU level `3` / `3` or `rustyquest.makepad.xrRenderScale=1.0` only as explicit
  stress/full-resolution runs.
- Current S92 performance comparison: the public fast target held about
  `72.9/72Hz` with zero numeric `Tear` / `Stale`, low app-process CPU, paired
  GPU buffers, and `cpuUploadCount=0`. Makepad S91 held about `90.5/90Hz` with
  zero numeric `Tear` / `Stale`, app/XR/draw cadence near `90Hz`, paired camera
  texture updates near `50Hz`, and substantially higher app-process CPU. Both
  runs used CPU/GPU level `4` / `4`, scale factor `0.75`, six byte-distinct
  screenshots, and fault-clean logs. Treat this as a transport/performance
  result only; Makepad projection math still requires headset visual acceptance.
- Current S93 refresh-normalized split: the public fast `0.75` target requested
  and activated `90.000Hz`, held `OpenXR` about `90Hz`, consumed camera pairs at
  `50.001Hz`, rendered projection frames at `90.007Hz`, and averaged `1.800`
  renders per distinct camera frame. Makepad S91 also held app/`XrUpdate`/draw
  cadence around `90Hz` with paired texture updates around `50Hz`. Operator
  headset review found that the Meta performance HUD itself was stereo-misaligned
  while Makepad was active, then stable/aligned after switching back to the
  public Quest baseline target under the same `90Hz` / level-4 device state. Treat the
  active Makepad blocker as XR presentation/view/layer state before further
  shader-only projection tuning.
- Current S95 direct-XR control: starting the generated XR activity directly
  with the Oculus VR category reached the expected runtime/projection markers
  and stayed fault-clean, but did not fix the headset-visible Meta performance
  HUD misalignment. Raw Horizon window metadata matched the public target's
  window class closely enough that the next split needed an upstream Makepad XR
  example as a third baseline before more camera-shader tuning.
- Current S96 upstream-baseline control: an upstream Makepad `dev` XR example
  build entered the generated XR activity, then toggled back to Makepad's
  normal Android activity and displayed a 2D screen. This is the same
  symmetric-activity-toggle failure isolated earlier in the Makepad recovery
  notes. The upstream scene-selection / hand-panel style UI is not a valid HUD
  baseline until the generated XR activity stays foreground through a minimal
  directional XR handoff guard.
- Current S97 guarded-upstream control: the same upstream example with only the
  directional XR handoff guard stayed in the generated XR activity, showed the
  old Makepad scene-picker style UI, and operator review did not see the Meta
  performance HUD stereo misalignment. Upstream GPU page-fault warning lines
  remain visible, so this is a HUD/presentation baseline rather than a
  GPU-fault-clean renderer baseline.
- Current S98 maintained-example control: this example now has a native
  passthrough-on HUD split that keeps the S91 camera/projection shader path but
  restores the two-layer OpenXR submission shape. The direct generated-XR gate
  reached active XR, emitted `s98NativePassthroughHudSplit=true`, submitted
  `nativePassthrough=true`, `projectionBlendSourceAlpha=true`, `layerCount=2`,
  captured six byte-distinct frames, and stayed GPU-fault/fatal clean while
  preserving the small hardware-buffer warning class. Operator headset review
  still saw Meta performance-HUD stereo misalignment, so this split did not
  fix the maintained camera path's HUD presentation defect.
- Current S99 maintained-fork scene-picker control: the original Makepad XR
  scene picker built from the same maintained fork stayed in the generated XR
  activity, submitted the same native-passthrough/two-layer OpenXR frame shape,
  and operator review reported that the Meta performance HUD was not
  stereo-misaligned. The remaining HUD defect is therefore specific to this
  camera example path. The smallest next split is render-scale: S99 used the
  fork's high default XR target size, while this camera example currently
  forces `0.75`.
- Current S100 render-scale control: raising this camera example to the
  scene-picker/default Makepad XR scale preserved HUD alignment only during
  launch and the green camera-arming placeholder. The HUD misalignment appeared
  when live camera content replaced the placeholder, and the high scale
  regressed stale frames, 90 FPS stability, and CPU load. Continue camera-path
  isolation at `0.75`.
- Current S101 camera-feed-suppressed control: camera acquisition/import stayed
  active at `0.75`, but the shader rendered a controlled diagnostic surface
  instead of sampling live YUV after arming. Operator review reported good HUD
  alignment. The remaining trigger is live camera projection/content, with a
  new coverage suspect: the diagnostic surface appeared to cover more area than
  the normal camera projection.
- Current S102/S103 coverage split: S102 kept live YUV sampling active but
  forced full-surface identity coverage, which kept the HUD aligned while
  making the camera feed intentionally full-screen. S103 keeps that full
  submitted surface active and moves coverage into the shader: camera pixels are
  drawn inside a content window with matte and border instead of resizing the
  OpenXR layer. A stable-link S103 rerun reached active XR, produced six
  byte-distinct freshness hashes, and passed operator headset review for HUD
  alignment plus the prior distance-dependent parallax defect. Keep S103 as the
  render-stack baseline; the remaining visual task is horizontal eye alignment
  inside the camera window.
- Current S104/S105 horizontal split: S104's `surface_to_camera` center-delta
  correction was objective-clean but still visibly offset. S105 follows the
  public target's projected shader path more closely by using the
  `screen_to_camera` center delta, then layers hotloadable manual UV offsets on
  top for headset-side fine tuning without rebuilds. The first screenshot
  derived tuning pass selected `Strength=0.425` as the default candidate
  because it best matched the public target's normalized left/right
  camera-content disparity while staying below the higher-strength range where
  edge striping became visible.
- Current S109 validation slice: camera-looking output is not sufficient visual
  proof when native passthrough may be active or the projection is full-screen.
  This slice disables native passthrough for the example and draws an
  unmistakable red border around the app-owned camera projection window. Treat
  screenshots without that marker as launch/presentation evidence only, not
  alignment evidence.
- Current S110 tuning slice: the camera-window sampler has a vertical UV
  hotload knob in the same `debug.rustyquest.makepad` property lane as the horizontal
  offsets and content scale. Keep per-device values in run notes or broker
  state; do not bake headset-specific alignment constants into reusable source
  without a separate public validation pass.
- Current cadence probe: rolling `RUSTY_QUEST_MAKEPAD_CADENCE` samples include
  Makepad `NextFrame`, draw-event, `XrUpdate`, and paired left/right camera
  texture-update counters. The S14 active launcher sample reported
  app/`XrUpdate`/draw cadence near 90Hz and paired texture-update cadence near
  50Hz.
- Current tracked warning: repeated small hardware-buffer lines appear in the
  device logs. They are not counted as GPU page faults, persisted through the
  successful paired import/projection marker gate, and should stay visible in
  the iteration ledger during performance comparison work.
- Current source/build slice: paired Makepad hardware-buffer import and
  projection-mapping markers are validated against the maintained fork checkout,
  launcher-path active presentation is validated, the fallback synthetic scene
  has been removed from the visual gate, and the rejected native `Video` widget
  diagnostic is disabled. S32 operator review reclassified the Makepad visual
  evidence as native compositor passthrough plus a low app-owned rectangle, not
  custom projection parity. S33 proved app-owned geometry and improved
  alignment, but the panel still rendered solid split-proof colors rather than
  camera pixels. S34 switched the custom panel to Makepad Y/U/V camera plane
  textures, but device validation still showed proof colors: only one CPU YUV
  stream updated, no paired visual bind completed, and one screenshot exposed an
  unwanted depth-clip/occlusion class where room geometry could cover the app
  panel. S35 keeps panel depth clipping disabled and treats a single updating
  CPU YUV stream as a camera-pixel proof only, not final zero-copy or stereo
  projection parity. The S35 device run did not yet validate that proof because
  the generated XR activity bounced back to the normal activity surface; the
  next slice is an explicit Makepad Android XR activity handoff fix before
  rerunning the YUV proof. The desired visual state for this proof is an
  app-owned panel without runtime depth/environment occlusion; passthrough
  behind the app layer is expected, but real-world geometry covering the panel
  is tracked as a separate depth-clip regression. S36 fixed the activity
  handoff: launcher and direct generated-XR routes now stay in active XR,
  emit YUV-ready/prepared/update and single-stream-proof markers, and remain
  app-fault clean. The visible panel still shows the blue/red proof state
  instead of camera pixels, so S37 focuses on the custom panel's late draw-var
  texture binding/redraw path before paired left/right ownership resumes.
  S37 added an explicit draw-vars-bound marker and kept the same stable/fault
  profile, but the visual result remained blue/red. S38 preferred the actually
  updating YUV stream and removed proof tint, and S39 forced the live
  camera-ready/YUV state onto the active draw area, but both still rendered the
  blue/red proof colors. S40 then made the waiting/default path neutral black
  and set the panel default to camera-ready. The S40 device gate is decisive:
  launcher and direct generated-XR routes stay in active XR, remain
  app-fault clean, keep depth/environment occlusion off, and now render a
  neutral black app-owned panel instead of blue/red. That proves the shader
  edits are active and moves the remaining blocker to Makepad YUV texture
  sampling/content rather than passthrough ambiguity, depth occlusion, activity
  handoff, or stale proof-color state. S41-S45 then proved the camera update
  event carries nonzero CPU-side Y/U/V plane content and kept active OpenXR
  presentation stable through gain-boosted luma, generated R8 Y-slot, generated
  all-slot, and constant shader-bypass controls. S46 proved the visible panel
  executes the edited shader body when the fragment path returns before any
  texture sampling: the panel turned green with the same guide overlay. The
  S47 then visibly sampled a generated R8 texture through the panel's
  `left_tex_y` slot, proving ordinary 2D texture-slot sampling works. The
  S48 disabled that generated replacement and visibly sampled the real Makepad
  camera Y plane through the same direct shader path. S49 removed the earlier
  gain-boost diagnostic and showed a no-gain monochrome camera image in the
  panel. Operator visual review confirmed camera feed visibility and moved the
  next gate to S50: rotate the direct camera-Y sample and center the app-owned
  diagnostic panel for head-forward inspection. S50b passed orientation and
  placement, but operator review identified a remaining left/right mirror. S51
  keeps the centered panel and uses a vertical-only camera-Y flip; the device
  gate retained clean counters and screenshot inspection shows the direct
  camera-Y panel upright, centered, and horizontally corrected. S52 then tried
  direct YUV-to-RGB color conversion in the same early-return shader path. The
  run stayed active-XR and app-fault clean, and CPU-side probes confirmed
  non-empty Y/U/V planes, but the headset view was strongly green/cyan. Per the
  Quest baseline color notes, that result is now treated as sampler/decode-shape
  evidence rather than final color calibration. The S53 gate visualizes the
  sampled Y, U, and V texture slots as separate grayscale bands before channel
  order, range, or matrix tuning resumes. S53 passed that slot-visibility gate:
  the screenshot shows live Y/U/V grayscale bands and clean counters, so the
  remaining color blocker is chroma interpretation. S54 swaps U and V in the
  YUV-to-RGB conversion while keeping the same centered/upright panel; that
  device gate shows real color camera feed instead of the earlier green/cyan
  failure, with the app still active-XR and app-fault clean. S55 keeps that
  plane-order fix and compares swapped-U/V limited/full range plus BT.601/BT.709
  variants in one grid, but its first device screenshot sampled different source
  regions per quadrant. S56 keeps the same formulas and remaps each quadrant to
  the same full camera view; that device gate stayed clean and made the
  comparison fair. The Quest hardware-buffer baseline reports BT.601 narrow
  range for the same camera format, so S57 collapsed the grid into a full-panel
  swapped-U/V limited-BT.601 candidate. S58 removed the center/split diagnostic
  guide and proved the shader edits were active with a border-only overlay, but
  visual review rejected the color claim because skin tones in the panel shifted
  blue/cyan. S59 therefore keeps the border-only panel and vertical flip, samples
  Android YUV_420_888 planes without swapping U/V, and keeps color acceptance
  false until per-eye projection catches up. The S59 run also adds a
  multi-frame screenshot freshness check: future visual gates should record
  whether expected live-camera screenshots are byte-identical before accepting a
  still image as live feed evidence. The Makepad parity suite now keeps this as
  a route-level hygiene signal: it captures multiple final frames and copies the
  newest final frame into the raw contact sheet. The first S59 clean install showed why
  launchers should pregrant `horizonos.permission.HEADSET_CAMERA` as well as
  `android.permission.CAMERA`; after that grant, S59 emitted the no-swap marker
  path, stayed app-fault clean, and produced a non-byte-identical screenshot
  sequence.
